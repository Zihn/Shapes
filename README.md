# Shapes
A prototype of a shape creation app for mobile. 

This has been untouched for more than 6 months. But the prototype works on mobile but still feels a bit clumsy.. 
The colorwheel function is something I really like. This and some pictures of created drawings are put in the Images folder.

Most of the testing can be seen in the ShapesOverlapTesting repository. But be aware of the many outcommented code and some messy scripting :).
